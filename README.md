An agentic framework to summarize and analyze resumes

The project is divided into these steps:
1. The user uploads a job description file (txt for now, pdf/docx to be supported later)
2. The user uploads a series of resumes (txt for now, pdf/docx to be supported later)
3. All resumes will be summarized into pre-defined categories: personal details, relevant skills and relevant duration of experience
4. A fitment analysis will be carried out against the given job description
5. A set of questions to ask will be suggested
6. If confirmed by the user, a personalized e-mail invitation will be sent to the candidate
